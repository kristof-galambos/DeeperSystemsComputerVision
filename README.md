## How to run the code:

The implementation is in warp_and_find_checker.py. Give the input path and the output path as command line arguments. For example if you download the zip and extract its content, you can run it as it is with "python warp_and_find_checker.py bgasmples bgsamples_output" in the command line.

## Others:

I can't find the circles on the images, currently I'm trying blurring, then canny edge detection, and then hough circles. That founds some of them. If anyone has suggestions on what else to try, how to find more circles, please tell me :D
